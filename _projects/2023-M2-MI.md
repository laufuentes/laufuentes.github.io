In this master's course project, our work focused on the article "Efficient globally optimal segmentation of cells in fluorescence microscopy images using level sets and convex energy functionals". We implemented some of the algorithms presented and created 3 different notebooks to explore the effects of energy functions and its parameters over cell images.
