excerpt: 'In this master's course project centered around "unsupervised learning," our primary goals encompass the replication of key findings from the research paper titled "Learning from missing data with the binary latent block model." Additionally, we aim to provide a comprehensive computational overview of the Latent Block Model (LBM) tailored for Missing Not at Random (MNAR) scenarios.'
