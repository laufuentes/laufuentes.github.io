excerpt: 'For our final project, we've delved into the realm of variational inference, focusing specifically on the paper titled "Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference". Our primary goal is to understand and implement the Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) algorithm proposed in the paper. This technique automates variational inference for complex probabilistic models, enabling its application to large datasets efficiently.'
