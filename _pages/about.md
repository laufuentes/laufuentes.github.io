Hello there, I'm Laura!
======


👩🏽‍💻 I'm a final-year master's student in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at Paris-Saclay University. 

I am currently completing my end-of-studies internship at [PreMeDICaL](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) INRIA-IDESP under the supervision of [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) in Montpellier, where I am working on policy learning and causal inference.

🎓 I will begin a Ph.D. in causal inference and policy learning under constraints in November 2024 under the supervision of [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/) and [Antoine Chambaz](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~chambaz/) at [PreMeDICaL](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) INRIA-IDESP and [MAP5](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr).

📚 My research interests include statistics, machine learning, causal inference, optimization, and precision medicine.
