Hello there, I'm Laura!
======

👩🏽‍💻 I'm a final-year master's student in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at Paris-Saclay University. I am currently completing my end-of-studies internship at INRIA-IDESP under the supervision of Julie Josse in Montpellier, where I am working on policy learning and causal inference.

🎓 I will begin a Ph.D. in causal inference and policy learning under constraints in November 2024.

📚 My research interests include statistics, machine learning, causal inference, optimization, and precision medicine.
