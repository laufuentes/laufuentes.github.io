In this talk, I introduced the foundations of policy learning, emphasizing how data-driven approaches can enhance decision-making processes. I also provided an overview of causal inference, covering its mathematical framework and key measures of causal effect, laying the groundwork for policy learning. We then explored various techniques for policy evaluation and optimization. Lastly, I presented some initial results, with further improvements expected in the coming months.
